# PuyoPuyo
A lightweight Puyo Puyo game made using SDL2

Makes heavy use of [ACGL](https://github.com/p0lyw0lf/ACGL), an SDL2 wrapper library to handle layouts/inputs. 
I am currently in the process of writing that library.

**THIS IS VERY UNFINISHED RIGHT NOW SORRY**, but I will try to make sure that any commits that make it here do build
something at that at least runs without segfaulting.
